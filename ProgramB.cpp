    Program Explanation:
    This program looks for a specific user's time log file based on their first and last name.
    If the log file is found, the program reads the contents of the file and validates the format of the log entries.
    The program then checks the validity of the log file and detects any errors in the log entries.
    If no errors are found, the program creates a report based on how many minutes are spent on each activity.
